## Questions

### 1. What is the primary purpose of the AssetManagerFXRP contract in the FAssets system?

**A)** To mint new XRP tokens on the XRP Ledger  
**B)** To manage the wrapping and unwrapping of XRP into FXRP on Flare Network  
**C)** To handle cross-chain transfers between Ethereum and XRP Ledger  
**D)** To provide liquidity for decentralized exchanges

### 2. In the FDC (Flare Data Connector) system, what is the purpose of the "attestation" process?

**A)** To verify user identities for KYC compliance  
**B)** To validate smart contract code before deployment  
**C)** To generate cryptographic proofs that verify cross-chain payment events  
**D)** To authenticate wallet connections

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The FDC (Flare Data Connector) attestation process generates cryptographic proofs that verify whether specific payment events occurred on external networks (like XRP Ledger), enabling trustless cross-chain operations.

---

### 3. What are the two main types of attestation requests supported by the FDC system in this project?

**A)** Payment attestation and referenced payment nonexistence  
**B)** Payment verification and identity verification  
**C)** Balance verification and transaction history  
**D)** Smart contract deployment and upgrade verification

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** The FDC (Flare Data Connector) system supports two types of attestation requests: payment attestation (verifying that a payment occurred) and referenced payment nonexistence (proving that a specific payment did not occur within a given timeframe).

---

### 4. What is the role of the "Data Availability Layer" in the FDC attestation process?

**A)** To store user personal information securely  
**B)** To manage blockchain node synchronization  
**C)** To store and retrieve attestation request data and proofs  
**D)** To handle wallet private key storage

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The Data Availability Layer stores attestation request data and the corresponding proofs, allowing them to be retrieved later for verification and execution of cross-chain operations.

---

### 5. In the minting process for FXRP, what is the purpose of the "collateral reservation" step?

**A)** To lock up user's existing FXRP as security  
**B)** To temporarily hold the user's XRP during the wrapping process  
**C)** To create a backup of the user's wallet  
**D)** To reserve XRP as collateral for the minting operation

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:** The collateral reservation step requires users to reserve XRP as collateral before minting FXRP, ensuring there's sufficient backing for the wrapped asset and providing security for the system.

---

### 6. What is the significance of the "round ID" in the FDC attestation system?

**A)** It identifies the specific voting round when attestation requests are processed  
**B)** It represents the block number on the Flare Network  
**C)** It indicates the number of transactions in a user's wallet  
**D)** It shows the version number of the smart contract

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** The round ID identifies the specific voting round in the FDC (Flare Data Connector) system when attestation requests are processed and validated by the network of attestation providers.

---

### 7. What is the purpose of the "agent vault" in the FAssets minting process?

**A)** To store user's private keys securely  
**B)** To provide insurance for failed transactions  
**C)** To act as an intermediary that handles the actual XRP transactions on XRP Ledger  
**D)** To manage user authentication

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The agent vault acts as an intermediary that handles the actual XRP transactions on the XRP Ledger, executing the minting or redemption operations on behalf of users.

---

### 8. In the redemption process, what does "referenced payment nonexistence" verification ensure?

**A)** That the user has sufficient FXRP balance  
**B)** That the user's wallet is properly connected  
**C)** That the smart contract is not paused  
**D)** That no conflicting payment was made to the same address within a specific timeframe

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:** Referenced payment nonexistence verification ensures that no conflicting payment was made to the same destination address within a specific timeframe, preventing double-spending and ensuring the redemption process is secure.

---

### 9. What is the relationship between "lots" and the actual XRP amount in the FAssets system?

**A)** Lots are abstract units that represent a specific amount of XRP based on the asset configuration  
**B)** 1 lot equals 1 XRP  
**C)** Lots are the same as drops (the smallest XRP unit)  
**D)** Lots represent the number of transactions a user can make

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** Lots are abstract units that represent a specific amount of XRP based on the asset configuration in the AssetManager contract. The actual XRP amount is calculated by multiplying the number of lots by the lot size.

---

### 10. What is the purpose of the "timelock" mechanism in the FAssets system?

**A)** To delay all transactions by a fixed amount of time  
**B)** To synchronize clocks between different blockchains  
**C)** To provide a security period where operations can be challenged before finalization  
**D)** To limit the number of transactions per day

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:** The timelock mechanism provides a security period where operations (like redemptions) can be challenged before finalization, adding an additional layer of security to the cross-chain asset system.
